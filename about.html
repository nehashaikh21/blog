        I have always loved cakes and desserts. I started baking when I was in class 11. The first thing I baked was a batch of vanilla cupcakes with my cousins. We got Betty Crocker cake mix and still managed to burn a couple of cupcakes haha. I, however, enjoyed the entire process so much that I decided to do it more often. I had no idea that it will grow into something so big and will become such an important part of me. I started posting pictures of my cakes on Instagram and surprisingly got a great response from the lovely community. This encouraged me to experiment more and work on my styling and photography- something I love doing now.

        I started blogging in December 2014 after being (almost) forced by my Instagram friends and now, I am glad they did. After blogging for almost a year, I decided to switch from a blog to a website of my own. While the look has changed, the idea of creating simple yet beautiful recipes is still at the core of ‘Bake With Shivesh’. I won the Outlook Social Media award in 2016 and got featured in Vogue’s list of “20 Under 26” in 2017. CondeNast Traveler India awarded me the Social Media Star of the year in 2017. In the same year, Homemade With Mess won the best dessert blog award by Better Homes and Gardens. In 2018 I won the Best Instagrammer of the Year at Living Foodz awards and the Best food feed of the year at Cosmopolitan blogger awards in 2019.

        I released my first book Homemade With Mess in November 2018. It was published by Harper Collins and became an Amazon bestseller. I am currently working on my second book that will release in February 2020.
